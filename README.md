# Smith-College-Interactive-Map

Emily's reflection:
What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
    Our original plan is to build the map for Smith for three specific buildings, and we can have an text-based adventure game on campus.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    We learned about switch case and hash map

Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
    I wish we should have not build our map upon things and places, because I think it is complicating our code. Implementing contract (or cheatsheet is the name) is extra right now, but it was clear to see which methods we need during coding. 

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
    One card, which can store dining dollars (or money) and help access the building doors. We now have onecards to access the terrace, and we can buy stuff with the money attribute with the player. We would only need to create another class of onecard with similar methods and attributes, which we don't have the time to build. 

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    I think it would be the advice from Jordan, when I asked the idea of merging the buildings into one map. This just assured that we were on the right track, and helped us build confidence with what we had.

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would suggest that first build the architature digaram, and plan out the relations with wach classes. Because there was a time that everything in player, game set up and main just crushes and we have no idea where to start debugging.

If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
    We worked smoothly, although it was quite overwhelming because we started the project late.
    Everyone worked on a building, and coded some methods. I also coded thing, player and main, which I think caused some problem while working.
