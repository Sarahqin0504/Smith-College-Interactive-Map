# Smith-College-Interactive-Map

Emily's reflection:
What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
    Our original plan is to build the map for Smith for three specific buildings, and we can have an text-based adventure game on campus.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    We learned about switch case and hash map

Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
    I wish we should have not build our map upon things and places, because I think it is complicating our code. Implementing contract (or cheatsheet is the name) is extra right now, but it was clear to see which methods we need during coding. 

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
    One card, which can store dining dollars (or money) and help access the building doors. We now have onecards to access the terrace, and we can buy stuff with the money attribute with the player. We would only need to create another class of onecard with similar methods and attributes, which we don't have the time to build. 

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    I think it would be the advice from Jordan, when I asked the idea of merging the buildings into one map. This just assured that we were on the right track, and helped us build confidence with what we had.

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would suggest that first build the architature digaram, and plan out the relations with wach classes. Because there was a time that everything in player, game set up and main just crushes and we have no idea where to start debugging.

If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
    We worked smoothly, although it was quite overwhelming because we started the project late.
    Everyone worked on a building, and coded some methods. I also coded thing, player and main, which I think caused some problem while working. 


Sarah's reflection:
What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
To manage the various elements of the Smith College Interactive Map, such as buildings and the natural surroundings, my main strategy involved utilizing the principles of inheritance and interfaces in order to generate a more efficient solution. By taking an object-oriented approach, we were able to create a codebase that was more organized and scalable.


What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
This project required me to create an engaging and player-friendly interactive world, much like Zork. In this way, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of game mechanics and player interaction in a virtual environment. Previously, our assignments consisted of work within a single course or had minimal interactions between different courses. Creating a cohesive landscape that incorporates multiple interconnected classes in this assignment taught me how to build games with a more extensive framework.


Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
OI believe an important improvement would be to expand the Outdoor Garden class within the project. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the Lyman Plant House, visitors should explore the Outdoor Garden first. Therefore, I intend to alter the starting point of the tour to begin in the Outdoor Garden instead of the Church Gallery in the Botanic Garden. Unfortunately, I have not been able to extensively refine the Outdoor Garden class due to time constraints. The Church Gallery remains the most practical place to begin a visitor's experience for now.


If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
Given unlimited time, I would like to make the interactive map more accurate to reality, thus providing users with a means of learning more about Smith College. In the Botanic Garden class, I would strive for greater accuracy in depicting the garden. I also intend to use Guava to integrate photos of plants and flowers into the codebase for educational purposes. Additionally, I would like to implement a feature that allows visitors to select the season of their virtual visit, so that they can experience the garden's seasonal plants.


What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
I received a lot of constructive feedback about how important it is to structure the codebase effectively at the beginning. Taking this advice helped me prioritize foundational coding structures before tackling detailed features, ensuring that the project is robust and maintainable. Also, going to the TA session allows me to solve the bug in the GameSetup.java, allowing the player to move around on campus.


If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
I would recommend starting with the overall setup for the interactive map, including all core functionalities like methods implemented inthe Player, Place and GameSetup class, before diving into specifics like individual building classes. In this way, development would have been streamlined and potential restructuring would have been minimized.




If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
Our team fostered a highly collaborative environment. At first, we concentrated on our individual classes, but then we convened weekly to discuss the project's broader picture. Emily and I were responsible for the overarching setup, such as enabling the player to move between classes and take actions. This project provided an incredible opportunity for teamwork and shared learning. We were able to collectively refine and share our perspectives on the construction of many methods, including 'buy' and 'move' methods, since they were applicable to multiple classes.
